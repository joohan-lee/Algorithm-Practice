# Description

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

# Solutions

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        max = 0
        for i in range(len(prices)-1):
            for j in range(i+1, len(prices)):
                if max < prices[j] - prices[i]:
                    max = prices[j] - prices[i]
        return max if max > 0 else 0
```

> Time Limit Exceeded. Brute Force는 불가.

recurrence formula:

- when i is included in the optimal solution, $OPT(i) = v_i - min(v_k) \text{ for k in 1,...,i-1}$
- when i is not included in the opt. sol., $OPT(i) = OPT(i-1)$

```python

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        min_price = float('inf')
        max_profit = 0
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            if prices[i] < min_price:
                min_price = prices[i]
            elif max_profit < prices[i] - min_price:
                max_profit = prices[i] - min_price
        return max_profit
```

### Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity :  O(n^2) - Brute Force, O(n) - One pass, where n is the length of array.
- Space complexity : O(1). Only two variables are used.
